Ash sat on the driver's bench of his wagon, reins loose in his hands as his two draft horses, Copper and Clay, plodded forward at their steady pace. [warmly] The wagon creaked and rattled with the comfortable sounds of a home on wheels, its colorful panels faded by sun and weather, collections of salvaged parts tied to the exterior like strange wind chimes.

[with wonder] The sky was impossibly blue, the kind of blue that the old world had almost forgotten existed before the collapse. [thoughtfully] Ash had seen pictures in the archives, photographs from a hundred years ago where the sky looked gray even on clear days. [appreciatively] Now, eight decades after everything fell apart, the air was clean enough to taste. Sweet, almost.

[descriptively] He was twenty-three years old, with the kind of lean build that came from constant travel and physical work. His clothes were practical, layers that could be added or removed as the day demanded, all of them showing the marks of his trade. Grease stains on his sleeves. A burn mark on one knee from a soldering accident. Pockets bulging with small tools, wire, and the odd screw or bolt that might prove useful."""
